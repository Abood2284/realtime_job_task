# Challenges & Tech Stack
* State Management
   * Used Getx -> For navigation and routing ( Although Naviagtion 1.0 was enough )
   * Used Provider -> Change Notifier on Employee Model to track changes
    
 
* Challenges
    * UI Date Picker -> I tried to get to what Figma design wanted about the Date Picker, but seemed impossible to achieve such design as Flutter uses showDatePicker, to pick dates, whilst showDatePicker isnt a widget, and cannot be displayed among other button widgets, there was a otehr approach to this using DatePickerDialog, but this in latest update has been through some changes, and doenst work for picking dates.  I tried to achieve the closed UI possible. I am open to improvements and what fellow developers have done.
    * NO Bloc -> It has been along time since i used Bloc, and suing Bloc for such small app would have put in more bugs and toubles, and had also led in delay of submission
